# typography.css

Typography.css is a base style template for website typography. I found myself constantly re-styling typography in similar ways for every site I worked on, and so I took the most common, basic styles and pulled them into their own default stylesheet.

Most of the typography decisions reflected in this style sheet are based on Matthew Butterick's book, [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com). I highly recommend it for anyone interested in improving their typography skills.

## Getting started

Place the typography.css file in your site folder structure and link to it in the head of the html files. Or, copy the styles into your main CSS file. From there, I recommend you change from the default Helvetica font and adjust the styles accordingly for the new font, following the guidelines in [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com).

## Components

The basic html elements have all been covered: headings, paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, blockquotes and horizontal rules.
