# typography.css

Typography.css is a base style template for website typography. I found myself constantly re-styling typography in similar ways for many sites, so I took the most common, basic styles and pulled them into their own default stylesheet.

Most of the typography decisions reflected in this style sheet are based on Matthew Butterick's book, [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com). I highly recommend it for anyone interested in improving their typography skills.

## Typography guidelines

The typography guidelines I focused on were:

1. Make sure the line length isn't too long. It should be somewhere between 45 and 90 characters to be a readable length.
2. Body text on the web should be between 15 and 20 pixels. This is larger than text sizes in print because we look at screens from further away than books.
3. Default heading sizes in HTML are gargantuan. There are better ways to draw attention to them. Headings here are bold and slightly larger than the body text, not double or triple in size.
4. Line height should be a comfortable size, not too tall and not too short. Somewhere between 120% and 140% of the text size.
5. Paragraphs are separated with spacing (margins) equal to 50-100% of the body text size, not separated with an extra return.

## Getting started

Place the typography.css file in your site folder structure and link to it in the head of the html files. Or, copy the styles into your main CSS file. From there, I recommend you change from the default Helvetica font and adjust the styles accordingly for the new font, following the guidelines in [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com).

## Components

The basic html elements have all been covered: headings, paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, blockquotes and horizontal rules.
