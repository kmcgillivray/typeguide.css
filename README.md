# typography.css

Typography.css is a base style template for website typography. I found myself constantly re-styling typography in similar ways for every site I worked on, and so I took the most common, basic styles and pulled them into their own default stylesheet.

## Getting started

Place the typography.css file in your site folder structure and link to it in the head of the html files. From there, I recommend you change from the default Helvetica font and adjust the styles accordingly for the new font, following the guidelines in [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com).

## Components

The basic html elements have all been covered: headings, paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, blockquotes and horizontal rules.
